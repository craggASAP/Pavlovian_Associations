## Project Overview

This repository contains scripts for analyzing and plotting: (1) ACh release dynamics across the 3D volume of the striatum using a multi-fiber photometry array in head-fixed behaving mice, in response to cues, rewards, and spontaneous licking during the learning and extinction of Pavlovian associations; (2) Behavioral changes (licking and movement) during the learning and extinction of Pavlovian associations; (3) DA release dynamics in the anterior dorsal striatum using a multi-fiber photometry array in head-fixed behaving mice, in response to cues, rewards, and spontaneous licking during the learning and extinction of Pavlovian associations. (4) Glutamate release onto cholinergic interneurons in the anterior dorsal striatum in head-fixed behaving mice, in response to cues, rewards, and spontaneous licking during the learning and extinction of Pavlovian associations; and (5) Behavioral changes following ACh release inactivation in the anterior dorsal striatum during the learning and extinction of Pavlovian associations.These scripts were custom-written by Safa Bouabid and used in the study [Distinct spatially organized striatum-wide acetylcholine dynamics for the learning and extinction of Pavlovian associations.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39071401/).

## Data Availability

Both raw datasets and processed and organized datasets are available at [Zenodo](10.5281/zenodo.14728851) in separate .zip folders for each figure.

------------------
## Documentation and Working Example

The processed and organised datasets are used directly by the **figure_code.m** and **sup_figure_code.m** scripts found in [**Analysis Codes**](https://github.com/Safa-Bouabid/Pav-Paper/tree/58d77dc9df8d06ebf460e331e690eda6714c84c1/analysis%20codes) folder to generate panels within each figure (both main and supplementary). The processed and organized data (in .mat or .xlsx format) can be found at [Zenodo](10.5281/zenodo.14728851) in **processed_data** subfolders within individual .zip folders corresponding to each figure. In addition to the **processed_data** subfolder, each .zip folder includes the following files:

1) **CT_across_GXX_mice**, contains information of fiber locations for ACh data mice, and CT_across_DLXX_mice, contains information of fiber locations for DA data mice.
 
2) **across_mice_lick_index_data_whole_ITI.mat** contains licking data from GRAB-ACh and iGluSnFR mice.
   * For each mouse, the `single_trial_struct` field (organized by each recording session) includes lick counts within a specified duration before cue onset (pre-licking) and during the inter-trial interval (ITI-licking). It also contains a lick index calculated based on pre-licking and ITI- licking.
   * The `single_trial_taking_all_ITI_frame` field is similar to `single_trial_struct`, except that ITI-licking is calculated across the entire inter-trial interval.
   * The `single_trial_rew` field contains lick counts during the reward consumption period (0â€“3 seconds after reward delivery).
   
3) **components_window_activity_filtered_rebase_rew_consump.mat** contains (for each *event_phase*, for each mouse), at single trial level, neural signal triggered at cue_onset/reward_consumption.
   * The three dimension of field `activity` are *timewindow*, *number_of_ROIs+3* and *number_of_trials*.
   * Fields `mu`,`sem` and `null` contains *mean*, *standard error of mean* and *control calculated based on `activity`*.
     *event_phase*: events includes combinations composed of aligning events [cue1/2, rew1/2 (reward of cue1/2),unprd(unpredicted reward)] for learning phase [early,late,LEDomi,Toneomi].
     *number_of_ROIs+3*: +3 is because lick count, linear velocity and angular velocity is appended in front of neural signal along the second dimention of the array `activity`.

4) **components_window_activity_filtered_rebase_rew_consump_rew_merged.mat** has the same structure as **components_window_activity_filtered_rebase_rew_consump.mat**, except that rew1 now contains merged data from rew1 and rew2.
   
5) **event_aligned_highpass03** has a similar structure to **components_window_activity_filtered_rebase_rew_consump**, but the data is organized by recording session instead of learning phases.
   
6) **tri_avg_single_filtered_rebase_rew_consump.mat** contains dimension-reduced data based on **components_window_activity_filtered_rebase_rew_consump**.
   * Field `mu_location_value` contains amplitudes and timings of each waveform component for all ROIs. The three dimentions represents components [early peak,dip,late peak], number of ROIs, measures [amplitudes and timing].
   * Field `mu_location_value_significance` contains significance of each components [early peak,dip,late peak] measured by comparing component amplitudes against control amplitude.
   * Field `single_values` contains, at single trial level, amplitudes of each waveform component for all ROIs. The three dimentions represents components [early peak,dip,late peak], number of ROIs, number of single trials.
   * Field `half_max_dur` contains, duration information of each waveform component for all ROIs measured at the half-max amplitude.
   * The three dimentions represents components [early peak,dip,late peak], number of ROIs, measures [half-max duration, leading timing at half-max amplitude in second, ending timing at half-max amplitude in second, leading timing in frame, ending timing in frame].
   * Field `half_max_dur_single` contains, at single trial level, similar information as `half_max_dur`. The single trial dimension is set to be the fourth dimension.
   
7) **tri_avg_single_filtered_rebase_rew_consump_rew_merged.mat** has the same structure as tri_avg_single_filtered_rebase_rew_consump, except that rew1 now contains the merged data from rew1 and rew2.
   
8) **ITI_licking_components_window_activity_filtered.mat** contains spontaneous lick-onset aligned data of GRAB-ACh mouse.
   * The field `data` contains three cells: [sample_rate, timing of lick-onset in frame, *data array*]. This *data array* have three dimensions, which represents timewindow, *number_of_ROIs+3* and number_of_trials.
